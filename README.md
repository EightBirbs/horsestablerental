# HorseStableRental

With the horse stable rental mod, you will only provide the stable space and rent it to horse owners.

Your only duty is to provide the necessary food and water for the horses in the stable. The horse owners will take care of everthing else.
They will take their horses for a ride and clean them.

As you are only providing the stable and do not own the horses, you won't be able to ride the horses and to sell them. Both triggers are deactivated for all horse husbandries, if this mod is enabled.
You also won't be able to buy horses for yourself and place them into a stable (that feature is planned for further releases of the mod though).

Once you buy and place a horse stable, each hour a horse owner will rent a place in your stable until it's at full capacity.

At the end of the day you will receive the rent from the horse owners, which currently is 150.00 $ per horse, per day.

But be careful, make sure that the horses always have food and water available. If there is no food or water available at the end of the day, the horse owners will punish you, by paying less rent.
